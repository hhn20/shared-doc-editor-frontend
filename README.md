This is the frontend for the doc editing project. 

Phase 1 will contain the following steps:
1. Create 4 pages: login/register, doc list page, rich text editor page, user profile page.
2. Add JS that is able to call APIs to load the docs list, load doc content.
3. Add quill.js and study how we can extract document/deltas.
